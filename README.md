**TO DO:**

Roadrunner (new ship)
  * a light "sprinter" destroyer
  * streamlined/sleek shape but still asymmetric
  * "Escape Drive" ship system; similar to Burn Drive however, weapons are completely disabled while active and controls are not locked (steering possible) but maneuverability is still reduced from the normal amount

Tug Drones (ship system)
  * 2x drones fly in formation with ship, and a visible tow-line effect
  * grant top-speed bonus to ship for each active drone

Thorn (new ship)
  * frigate
  * new hullmod: Dead Man's Switch Auto-Scuttle Device
    * internal graviton generator
     * generator connected to internal, armoured flux capacitor array
      * activates on "dead-man's switch" (whenever ship becomes Hulk in a battle)
      * increases mass dramatically
    * burn drive also activates on dead-man's switch
      * causes the hulk's engines to activate (different color)
      * continuously rotates the hulk to face the direction of the nearest hostile ship (non-fighter, non-missile)
      * ridiculous acceleration
    * after pre-set amount of time, ship detonates dealing high damage and high EMP
    * will not activate if ship explodes due to friendly fire, asteroid impact, or if there no suitable targets within pre-set range

FX
  * particle effect for the Fusion Torpedo; soft particle stream that points at its target for increased menace

Music
  * either combat, campaign or elsewhere: Sheherazade by wnm (edited for looping)
