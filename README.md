**TO DO:**

Lore
  * text descriptions for all things that are missing one
  * long descriptions for all ships, with a cutoff at the appropriate place to fit in the two possible display areas

Balance
  * roadrunner - enact a peak active timer like the Medusa
  * general shield efficacy + vent time audit on all ships

Music
  * either combat, campaign or elsewhere: Sheherazade by wnm (edited for looping)

Dialogues:

StarSystem:(very empty)
-Nebula somewhere?
-Size station?
-More planets owner per Nomads?

Need to be re-made per Snrasha/ Coders:
-Unique Oasis. (Vanilla code : https://github.com/Trylobot/ss-nom) 
-Others things?

Need to be changed:
-Delete the white star nur who do not exist on reality.

Urgent:
-Reput the Unique Oasis: 
Why?  Because Nomads factions is a faction who have a small station of size 3 for the moment, but not for that.
Nomads mod have a special fleet who go around the world, a big fleet who contains a Oasis than you need to destroy for have a Oasis.
-Only means for obtain big ship, for the moment, this is just scavage. Or just black Market.
