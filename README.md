**TO DO:**

Roadrunner (new ship)
  * destroyer, light
  * "sprinter" used for pursuit/harassment
  * new long range + EMP weapon used similarly to the Tachyon Lance for disabling target engines
  * engine animation
    * create a multi-frame animation for the engine, which varies animation speed according to whether the ship is accelerating forward
    * forward thrust = fast anim speed, otherwise still animating but much slower
    * 24 frames of animation, 2 per valve, valves overlap
  * streamlined/sleek shape while still asymmetric
    * look at "engines" on google images for inspiration; looking for aircraft-like twin engine design, should take up 50% of the ship
  * Tug Drones (ship system)
    * grant top-speed bonus to ship for each active drone
    * 2x drones fly in formation with ship, and a visible tow-line effect
      * each drone has a specific attachment point on the ship
      * drone and ship each have decorative weapon with multi-frame sprite animation
      * look at "spiderweb lens flare" for the desired effect in the animation
      * animation frame is determined by angle between attachment points
      * need a fallback animation when distance is less than long dimension of sprite animation
      * should look like an invisible line between drone and ship

Nomad Mining Rig
  * has standard mining blasters/lasers
  * has a push beam and a pull beam
  * has the ability to call an asteroid apocalypse on the battlefield, probably destroying everything. (Yes.)

Music
  * either combat, campaign or elsewhere: Sheherazade by wnm (edited for looping)
