**TO DO:**

(unnamed) (new ship)
  * bomber wing, 3x
  * name ideas:
    * Claw
    * Fang
    * Thorn
    * Nettle
    * Barb
    * Spur
    * Spearhead
    * Revenant
    * Revenge
    * Reprisal
    * Retribution
  * basic fighter armaments; mini fusion torps, basic PD
  * new hullmod: Dead Man's Switch Auto-Scuttle Device
    * internal graviton generator
     * generator connected to internal, armoured flux capacitor array
      * activates on "dead-man's switch" (whenever ship becomes Hulk in a battle)
      * increases mass dramatically
    * burn drive also activates on dead-man's switch
      * causes the hulk's engines to activate (different color)
      * continuously rotates the hulk to face the direction of the nearest hostile ship (non-fighter, non-missile)
      * ridiculous acceleration
    * after pre-set amount of time, ship detonates dealing high damage and high EMP
    * will not activate if ship explodes due to friendly fire, asteroid impact, or if there no suitable targets within pre-set range
    * any time one of them is hulked (but not completely destroyed), after a brief activation window period (say 3-5 seconds) the game would spawn some kind of fiery-death-missile (not the Doom Cannon projectile, something new entirely) that is about the same size as the bomber's hull but with some kind of neat particle FX. This missile would be meant to represent the fighter hulk activating its dead-man's switch, so it will spawn with the same initial position, velocity and angular velocity as the hulked fighter, and the hulk object is removed from combat at the same time; it will then accelerate toward a target of opportunity nearby. I'm thinking the nearest enemy Frigate or larger.
    * Factoring in a second idea that was suggested by someone earlier in the thread, the engine profile of this "phoenix missile" system could be something that has no practical top speed and decent acceleration, so this projectile would very quickly become nigh-unavoidable. And just to make things super-fun, we could set the damage of the missile to something reasonably dangerous, in the neighborhood of 40% to 80% of a Reaper Torpedo. After all, you did just lose a fighter chassis (and a crewman). To be fair, I'd have to set the CR-per-deployment much higher for this theoretical fighter wing so that it has fewer than normal replacement chassis (if any).

Roadrunner (new ship)
  * a light "sprinter" destroyer
  * streamlined/sleek shape but still asymmetric
  * "Escape Drive" ship system; similar to Burn Drive however, weapons are completely disabled while active and controls are not locked (steering possible) but maneuverability is still reduced from the normal amount

Tug Drones (ship system)
  * 2x drones fly in formation with ship, and a visible tow-line effect
  * grant top-speed bonus to ship for each active drone

FX
  * particle effect for the Fusion Torpedo; "orbiter" particles

Music
  * either combat, campaign or elsewhere: Sheherazade by wnm (edited for looping)
