{"name":"ss-nom","tagline":"Starsector Mod: The Nomads","body":"This mod adds a new faction, _The Nomads,_ to the game with custom ships and weapons. They are universally hostile, except to the player and the other neutral or independent factions. The _Armada Fleet_ will depart from the _Nur_ system and journey around the sector for as long as it can. If, however, the _Oasis_ is destroyed, the escort fleets will scatter. The _Oasis_ is available for sale during the brief period following its destruction, from the station in the _Nur._ It also adds some demo missions to allow for a quick preview of the content.\r\n\r\n**Credits**\r\n* Trylobot: Design, Programming, Artwork\r\n* Cycerin: Sound\r\n\r\n### [Original Forum Post](http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=162.0)\r\n### [Buy Starsector](http://fractalsoftworks.com/preorder/)\r\n\r\n![The Nomads Roster](http://i.imgur.com/ZU4G0PO.png)\r\n\r\n**TO DO:**\r\n\r\nRoadrunner (new ship)\r\n  * a light \"sprinter\" destroyer\r\n  * streamlined/sleek shape but still asymmetric\r\n  * \"Escape Drive\" ship system; similar to Burn Drive however, weapons are completely disabled while active and controls are not locked (steering possible) but maneuverability is still reduced from the normal amount\r\n\r\nTug Drones (ship system)\r\n  * 2x drones fly in formation with ship, and a visible tow-line effect\r\n  * grant top-speed bonus to ship for each active drone\r\n\r\nThorn (new ship)\r\n  * frigate\r\n  * new hullmod: Dead Man's Switch Auto-Scuttle Device\r\n    * internal graviton generator\r\n     * generator connected to internal, armoured flux capacitor array\r\n      * activates on \"dead-man's switch\" (whenever ship becomes Hulk in a battle)\r\n      * increases mass dramatically\r\n    * burn drive also activates on dead-man's switch\r\n      * causes the hulk's engines to activate (different color)\r\n      * continuously rotates the hulk to face the direction of the nearest hostile ship (non-fighter, non-missile)\r\n      * ridiculous acceleration\r\n    * after pre-set amount of time, ship detonates dealing high damage and high EMP\r\n    * will not activate if ship explodes due to friendly fire, asteroid impact, or if there no suitable targets within pre-set range\r\n\r\nMusic\r\n  * either combat, campaign or elsewhere: Sheherazade by wnm (edited for looping)","google":"UA-44885201-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
