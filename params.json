{"name":"ss-nom","tagline":"Starsector Mod: The Nomads","body":"# [Starsector Mod: The Nomads](http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=162.0)\r\n\r\nThis mod adds a new faction, _The Nomads,_ to the game with custom ships and weapons. They are universally hostile, except to the player and the other neutral or independent factions. The _Armada Fleet_ will depart from the _Nur_ system and journey around the sector for as long as it can. If, however, the _Oasis_ is destroyed, the escort fleets will scatter. The _Oasis_ is available for sale during the brief period following its destruction, from the station in the _Nur._ It also adds some demo missions to allow for a quick preview of the content.\r\n\r\n**Credits**\r\n* Trylobot: Design, Programming, Artwork\r\n* Cycerin: Sound\r\n\r\n### [Buy Starsector](http://fractalsoftworks.com/preorder/)\r\n\r\n![The Nomads Roster](http://i.imgur.com/XZc8rnA.png)\r\n\r\n**TO DO:**\r\n\r\nWeapons: All Nomads Ships\r\n  * new PD weapon: **Firecracker** - a short-range flak effect akin to a shotgun, limited ammo but regenerates charges\r\n  * replace point-defense usage of light/ultralight electron masers with this new PD weapon; remove PD hint on light/ultralight\r\n  * some light/ultralight usage will remain where it serves as a primary or important weaponry\r\n\r\nWeapons: Scorpion, Flycatcher, Toad\r\n  * new missile weapons: **Self-Sustained Fusion Torpedo** (small + large) \r\n  * replace any use of missiles with large and small SSFT's\r\n  * second possible missile system idea; high top-speed LRM with bad turn rate (idea WIP)\r\n\r\nRattlesnake (new ship)\r\n  * cruiser, heavy, armored\r\n  * new heavy maser variant: The Ripper - triple barreled heavy electron maser, with slightly increased range and firing rate (and flux gen)\r\n  * uses Firecrackers and SSFTs\r\n  * for the first time on a Nomad ship, empty universal weapon slots; will be assigned to some sort of ballistic kinetic by default\r\n\r\nThorn (new ship)\r\n  * frigate\r\n  * new hullmod: Dead Man's Switch Auto-Scuttle Device\r\n    * internal graviton generator\r\n     * generator connected to internal, armoured flux capacitor array\r\n      * activates on \"dead-man's switch\" (whenever ship becomes Hulk in a battle)\r\n      * increases mass dramatically\r\n    * burn drive also activates on dead-man's switch\r\n      * causes the hulk's engines to activate (different color)\r\n      * continuously rotates the hulk to face the direction of the nearest hostile ship (non-fighter, non-missile)\r\n      * ridiculous acceleration\r\n    * after pre-set amount of time, ship detonates dealing high damage and high EMP\r\n    * will not activate if ship explodes due to friendly fire, asteroid impact, or if there no suitable targets within pre-set range\r\n\r\nScript Optimizations\r\n  * audit all scripts for memory/CPU usage, reduce use of class statics that store references to persistent API objects to allow for efficient GC","google":"UA-44885201-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
