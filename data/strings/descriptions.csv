nom_planet_naera,CUSTOM,"Naera is an oddity among habitable planets. It is a poor candidate for conlonization due to its immense size, low density atmosphere and high surface temperature. Despite these difficulties a bold group of ancient pre-travel-drive explorers wound up in orbit around Naera. Their cryo-preservation systems had failed on a mission to another planet and they were forced to take refuge there. Using the remains of their vessel and technology, they settled on the surface and gradually adapted to its extreme conditions. This civilization eventually returned to the stars and earned themselves the title ""Nomads.""  They now spend most of their time off-planet, only to occasionally return during times of critical emergency.",,,
