nom_fang,SHIP,"Armed with Retribution launchers, Fang Bombers fill the role of damage otherwise lacking in the Nomad arsenal. (NB: this weapon is currently non-functional) ",,,
nom_toad,SHIP,"Toad heavy-fighters emphasise the overwhelming close-range firepower characteristic to Nomad combat tactics. With each fighter packing enough firepower to rival a frigate, a full wing can pose serious threat to any lone-wolf operator seeking a fast fortune.",,,
nom_gecko,SHIP,"Gecko drones are specialized robotic defense units, manufactured en-masse for exclusive use by the Oasis.",,,
nom_scarab,SHIP,"Scarabs are light and cheap to build, and most effectively deployed as short-range scouts. Due to its fragility and outdated design relative to post-Domain standards, Scarab wings do not serve well as fighter screens.",,,
nom_iguana,SHIP,"Iguana have unusually high flux capacity, but with a crew requirement to match. They are classed as Corvettes, yet fly in three-ship wings and can be field-refitted like fighters.",,,
nom_wurm,SHIP,"If any Domain citizen has ever seen a Nomad vessel in detail, chances are it would be a Wurm-class assault frigate. This staple design carries with it all of the core Nomad military virtues: short and powerful electron masers, relatively decent armor, and maintenance so simple that the vessel is almost self-sufficient. Wurms are the general-purpose ships in the Nomad fleet, serving as padding and filler for the various specialised or larger components of a combined-arms fleet. The threat of a single Wurm is near non-existent, akin to that of a shield-equipped Hound or Cerebus piloted by an over-ambitious rebel. However, when operated with the support of other ships, the prospect of being flanked and pounded into scrap becomes a grave concern. Commanders are reminded that masers were obsoleted due to their flux inefficiency and short-range, but are otherwise just as devastating as Tritachyon pulse lasers.",,,
nom_yellowjacket,SHIP,"The single, devastating sniper maser equipped on the Yellowjacket seems to be the best Nomads could do to stretch the range-limitations of  maser technology. The cost of overspecialisation is fairly extreme - the extensive support systems required to operate this stallion renders the rest of the Yellowjacket's performance profiles rather feeble. To make an analogy to Domain doctrine, Yellowjackets are similar to Vigilence-class frigates in their fleet-support roles. Its principle value to the Nomad arsenal is the addition of ranged firepower otherwise lacking in frontline ships, which greatly eases the difficulty Nomad fleets have when dealing with technologcially superior opponents.",,,
nom_death_bloom,SHIP,"Death-blooms are a relatively-rare sight due to its relatively expensive (in Nomad terms) manufacture and maintenance profile. Its signature weapon is the solar crucible, a fusion-powered beam weapon engineered specifically to slice through armor plating in contrast with the Nomad norm of generalist mase rs. Also strange is the inclusion of a Domain-compatible energy mount capable of interfacing modern weapons with the ancient Nemean flux configurations. Together with the fast and sleek profile, the established presence of Death-blooms in an otherwise low-tech faction strongly suggests that contact was not completely broken between thier disappearance from Domain space and the Collapse.

If so, it is almost certain that the same contacts forwarded Tritachyon shield technology now retrofitted on all Nomad ships. The shielding characteristics, as well as marginal compatibility with both Domain-standard weapons and modspecs, all point towards a recent influx of technology that the Nomads are struggling to incorporate into their existing assets. <REST OF ENTRY REDACTED>",,,
nom_flycatcher,SHIP,"The Flycatcher ultralight carrier presents a strong case for Nomad ingenuity and refinement of venerable technologies. Few others could boast of what they have achieved: a fully-functioning strikecraft platform that could both match burns with the fastest frigate as well as defend itself in combat against opposing military ships. A tag-team of Flycatchers and combat frigates can thus outgun most equivalent fleets, then outrun heavier response fleets.

The Flycatcher's combination of speed and flexibility presents a pipedream for privateers, and a nightmare scenario for strategic commands of resident powers. If sufficiently antagonised, the Oasis fleet itself can theoretically resort to guerrilla warfare against the outer reaches of core systems by scattering fleets across multiple trade lanes. The imagined threat alone of inbound Flycatcher killteams would likely extirpate mid-sized trading within the local region and potentially even hamper black-market trade. This potential outcome has contributed to the current studious neutrality of planet-bound factions towards the Nomads, at least until counter-measures could be devised.",,,
nom_komodo,SHIP,"Equipped with a good mix of light and medium Nomad weaponry to engage faster-moving fighters and frigates, yet able to hold its own against other destroyers for brief periods.",,,
nom_komodo_mk2,SHIP,"A post-departure upgrade of the Komodo; more expensive to field, but more capable with respect to staying power and damage output.",,,
nom_roadrunner,SHIP,"The Roadrunner is a curious vessel. It is best described as a destroyer-sized interceptor - essentially a pair of unique, massive engines that are thinly wrapped by the rest of the ship. These beasts give Roadrunners powerful and sustained thrust both in and out of battle, compared to the short bursts employed by burn drives in the Domain doctrine. This characteristic would've made the Nomad invention highly sought after by mining and construction guilds, if only they returned in more civil times. Instead, it now propels an otherwise mediocre combat ship dedicated to interdiction and pursuit duties with an efficiency rivaling that of legendary Tritachyon Tempests.",,,
nom_scorpion,SHIP,"A specialized long-range missile support destroyer. This ship, while expensive to maintain and to field, can bring to bear a frightening volume of long-range ordnance.",,,
nom_rattlesnake,SHIP,"Good all-around heavy cruiser, meant to absorb punishment and dish it out with equal ferocity.",,,
nom_sandstorm,SHIP,"The Sandstorm is designed to charge into a fight with frontal weaponry blazing, and take out its target in a single pass. Prolonged engagements usually expose its high flux requirements.",,,
nom_gila_monster,SHIP,"The Gila Monster was invented to take on ancient battleships, which are then be looted for supplies and spare parts to refit the rest of the fleet. It utilizes its Doom Cannon for fierce but brief encounters. Like the sandstorm it is ill-equipped for long-term engagements.",,,
nom_oasis,SHIP,"Central to the survival of the Nomads in the present day, this behemoth civilian transport also aids its escort armada with custom logistical systems to enable indefinite away-journeys with no need to dock.",,,
,,,,,
nom_planet_naera,CUSTOM,"Naera is an oddity among habitable planets. It is a poor candidate for conlonization due to its immense size, low density atmosphere and high surface temperature. Despite these difficulties a bold group of ancient pre-travel-drive explorers wound up in orbit around Naera. Their cryo-preservation systems had failed on a mission to another planet and they were forced to take refuge there. Using the remains of their vessel and technology, they settled on the surface and gradually adapted to its extreme conditions. This civilization eventually returned to the stars and earned themselves the title ""Nomads.""  They now spend most of their time off-planet, only to occasionally return during times of critical emergency.",,,

nomads,FACTION,"Across the eons, only a small fraction of humanity have seriously contemplated trading an anchored life for an endless journey. Regardless of whether the choice was between a house and the roads, or a planet and the stars, people have generally preferred the stability of a sedentary life over one spent wandering through the vastness of Creation. Home was a concept rooted on firm ground, and even the most adventurous of pirates would find tempting the prospect of retirement into some freeport cartel. After all, who would tell their stories if they died ignominiously in some forgotten corner of the sector?

To those bitten with wanderlust, however, hyperspace travel was the ultimate gateway drug. One group of these minorities came to be called the Nomads - simply named due to the sheer age of their distinct civilisation relative to all other nomadic splinters. The Nomads' origin stretches before even the Domain of Man, when according to legend hyperspace was pierced by bright and colorful trails - outpacing the rudimentary droneships exploring the neighborhood of fabled Earth. A fleet of ill-fitted ships departed the cradle of humanity for the unknown expanse, carrying explorers who were driven to see the galaxy for themselves and who could not endure being spoilered by blurred hypercomm images. Neither the destination of this first fleet nor the names of their crew are now knowable, and given the dangers of hyperspace to long-term health unknown to the initial explorers, the present civilisation is most likely descended from later participants during the initial Domain epoch rather than the original fleet. Nevertheless, their indomitable spirit remains within all those who now call the Oasis fleet home.

Based on their current fleet technology, the initial Nomad fleet likely maintained sporadic contact with early Domain settlers, then broke off as the frontiers became increasingly militarized. The inexorable exploitation of both planet and people drove the Nomads away from colonized space, and were it not for the Collapse they would probably have never returned. At least, this is what the Oasis fleet claims after it emerged within hyperspace sensors and established contact with a thoroughly dumbfounded scavenger fleet. It seems that the Nomads became aware of the calamity - and then became curious of what had befallen humanity as each sector was left to fend for itself. The fleet currently tours this sector, mining resources from unclaimed planets and conducting restricted trade with the major factions, all the while maintaining respectable distance from population centers. A small outpost has even been established in a minor system, raising the suspicious eyebrows of many Hegemony and Tri-tachyon security officers.

Will they prove to be a painful reminder of ancient history, or a beacon to humanity's future?",,,
